- Quite often, as a developer, you will have to work with a larger amount of data. In this challenge, I worked with a more complicated set of data of countries and display it in a table.

### User stories

- #### Users can choose to filter by multiple regions, the regions can be Americas, Antarctic, Africa, Asia, Europe, or Oceania.

- #### Users can choose to filter countries that are members of the United Nations.

- #### Users can choose to filter countries that are independent.

- #### Users can filter/search for countries by their names, regions or subregions.

- #### Users can see the total number of countries.

- #### Users can select a country and see more details on a country page.

- #### On the country page, users can see info like population, area, capital,....

- #### On the country page, users can see the neighboring countries.

- #### On the country page, when users select a neighboring country, it should redirect to the according country page.
